## ScratchJr

#### Goal
Install ScratchJr on Raspberry Pi for Uganda partner schools (Mwebaza Foundation).

* Get it running on any flavor of Debian Linux (e.g. Ubuntu)
* Get it running on Raspberry Pi 3B
* Package the installation files in a way that could be installed "offline" on 45 Raspberry Pis in Uganda schools w/o internet (e.g. 1 or more .deb files for arm64 arch)


#### Details
We received a request from our partners at Mwebaza Foundation to see if we could get ScratchJr running on Raspberry Pi 3b.

ScratchJr was created by MIT for kids 5-7 yrs as an iPad / Android Tablet app.
But there is an open source version (https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop/) that has builds for Windows and Mac.
Since it's an Electron JS app ... it will potentially work on any system with nodejs.

Even if you only have access to a Ubuntu system, we can find KoC volunteers with various versions of Raspberry Pi hardware to assist with packaging and testing.
