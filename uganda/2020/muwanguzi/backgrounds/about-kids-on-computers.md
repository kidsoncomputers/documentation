## About Kids on Computers

Kids on Computers is a non-profit organization registered in the United States. We are based
in the state of Colorado, but have volunteers all over the world who contribute their time
and abilities to help setup computers for kids that have limited access to technology.

Besides our volunteers, we also rely heavily on the open source community for software and
free content.
